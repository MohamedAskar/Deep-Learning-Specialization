# Deep Learning Specialization
Deep Learning Specialization on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) 

Taught by: [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction
This repository contains all my programming assignments for this Specialization. Coursera provided a detailed explaination in each notebook for a better understanding and also some helper function to but you on a good start.

## Programming Assignments:
  - Course 1: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/MohamedAskar/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/1.%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning)
      - There are 5 Jupyter notebooks for each assignment in this course
  
  - Course 2: [Improving Deep Neural Networks Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://github.com/MohamedAskar/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/2.%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%20Hyperparameter%20tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization)
      - There are 6 Jupyter notebooks for each assignment in this course
  
  - Course 3: [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/MohamedAskar/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/3.%20Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects)
      - There is no programming assignments in this course, but you can definitely check my course certificate.
      
  - Course 4: [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/MohamedAskar/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/4.%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks)
      - Attached with this folder 7 Jupyter notebooks for each assignment in this course
      
  - Course 5: [Sequence Models](https://github.com/MohamedAskar/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/5.%20Sequence%20Models)
      - This is the last course in this Specialization and it contains 7 Jupyter notebooks for each assignment in this course
